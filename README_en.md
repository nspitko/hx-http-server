# HTTP Server
An HTTP server written in Haxe, with basic functionality ready and entering production stage.

# Support
- [x] Basic HTTP service functionality
Create a basic HTTP listening service:
```haxe
var ip:String = "0.0.0.0";
var port = 5555;
var http = new HTTPServer(ip, port, true);
http.start();
http.onConnectRequest = (client) -> {
   client.send("hello world.");
};
```
- [x] Basic routing functionality
Use the addRoute API to easily add routes for requests:
```haxe
http.route.addRoute("/", (http) -> {
	trace("Accessed / route", http.path);
	return true;
});
```
- [x] Custom routing service
Refer to the implementation of the `test/CustomRoute.hx` class.

- [x] Object reflection routing
Through an object, the reflection object class is automatically generated by the `http.macro.ReflectRouteMacro`, so that each of its public methods can be automatically converted into a routing method, and follow the optional and non-optional parameters, parameter names, etc. At the same time, you can directly inherit the `http.route.HTTPReflectCustomObject` to implement public methods, please refer to `ReflectCustomObject`.

- [ ] HTTPS
It requires a certificate test, which I have not done yet.

- [x] GET data
Get the parameters after ? through the client.param.get method.

- [x] POST data
Supports `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` support, can be obtained through `client.param.post`.

- [x] HEADER header information data
Get the header information parameters through the `client.param.header` method.

- [x] Data post-processing
Process the final output result through the `httpServer.onResponseAfter` interface, and you can modify the `client.response.data` parameter here to process the final output result.
